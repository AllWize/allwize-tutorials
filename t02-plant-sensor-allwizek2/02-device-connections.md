# Sensor connections

Next we will connect all sensors to the Connectors Carrier. Grove sensors are easy since the connector only fits one way, so there is no possible mistake here. You will have to connect the BME280 sensor to the port labeled `TWI` in the connectors board and the moisture sensor to the one labeled `A1`.

We will then connect the AllWize K2 to the carrier board (notice the orientation).
