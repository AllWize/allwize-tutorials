# Installing device dependencies to the Arduino IDE

To program our sensor we will need some libraries to interface the BME280 sensor and also to encode the message we will be transmitting to the gateway. We can easily install them from the Arduino IDE Library Manager under `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Labraries`. You wil have to search and install the latest version for these libraries:

* AllWize by AllWize.io (you probably have this already installed)
* Cayenne LPP by Electronic Cats
* ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon
* Adafruit BME280 Library (install also the depencies when prompted)
