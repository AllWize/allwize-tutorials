# Your first sensor with the AllWize K2

In this tutorial we will build a plant-health sensor that will monitor temperatura and humidity in the room where the plant is and also soil moisture. We will be encoding the data of the sensors using Cayenne LPP and send the to our gateway, that will in turn send it to a platform to graph them.
