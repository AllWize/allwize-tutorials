# Install Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE is a simple code editor that will allow you to create your sketches and upload them to the AllWize K2. It is open source and you can download it from the [Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and also make a donation to help the project.

The installation procedure will depend on your operating system.

## Windows

Don't forget to install the drivers for the Arduino boards. It is an option in the Arduino IDE installation process.

## MacOS

TODO: Arduino IDE installation instructions for MacOS

## Linux

Run the `arduino-linux-setup` utility in the folder you download using your user, it will configure the user groups to work with the boards and also remove non-compatible dependencies (they are safe to remove):

```
$ ./arduino-linux-setup.sh $USER

******* Add User to dialout,tty, uucp, plugdev groups *******

[sudo] password for allwize:         
groupadd: group 'plugdev' already exists
groupadd: group 'dialout' already exists

******* Removing modem manager *******

Restart the system once finished. You should be able to run the IDE now.
